Let's finalize the tech stack:
Frontend:
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap/Bootswatch
Bootstrap Icons
Font squirell (for fonts)
JavaScript
React
AnimeJS (for animations)
Backend:
Express.js
Node.js
Database:
NeonDB
Hosting:
Vercel (with separate deployments for frontend and backend)

Separate deployments will allow you to:
Optimize each deployment independently.
Scale frontend and backend separately.
Use different configurations and settings for each deployment.
This approach will also make it easier to manage and maintain your application.
Next steps:
Set up separate repositories or monorepos for frontend and backend.
Design the database schema for NeonDB.
Implement the backend API using Express.js and Node.js.
Build the frontend using React, AnimeJS, Bootstrap Icons, and Font Awesome.
Let's start with the backend. We can set up the Express.js project and design the database schema for NeonDB.
Here's a high-level overview of the backend API:
Authentication endpoints (e.g., login, register)
Attendance tracking endpoints (e.g., clock in/out, view attendance records)
User management endpoints (e.g., create, update, delete users)
How would you like to structure the backend API? Should we use a specific routing structure or follow a particular API design pattern?
